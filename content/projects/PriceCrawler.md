This project involves building a data pipeline to calculate inflation rates using online prices of goods and services from the Common Crawl dataset. A sample analysis of laptop prices revealed a 4.8% inflation rate in 2019, more than double the 2.3% reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, offering insights for investment strategies and business decision-making.
