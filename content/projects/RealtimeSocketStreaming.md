This project builds a real-time data pipeline that acquires data over TCP/IP sockets, processes it using Apache Spark with sentiment analysis from ChatGPT4, streams it via Kafka, and replicates it in Elasticsearch for advanced querying and visualization. It offers insights through tools like Kibana, Power BI, and Tableau, ensuring seamless data flow and analysis.
